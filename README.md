# Cisco Networking Lab

## Objective
The Cisco Networking Lab aims to provide some knowledge on the configuration and management of Cisco switches and routers. In this lab, I configured basic configurations onto a Cisco switch and connected it to a Cisco router to create a small home network. Furtehrmore, this lab gave me knowledge on aspects of network management and security, such as VLANS, port security, and static routing. Overall, the goal of this lab was to manage my own network and connect it to other switches like you would find in a corporate enviroment.
